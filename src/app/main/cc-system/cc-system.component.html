    <p class="mat-body-1 text-light">
      In a few words, the Moonshiner method is a smart and very easy way to
      manage the entire Reef Chemistry on a Reeftank in the most effective way
      that will allow the Reefkeeper to grow nearly any coral since there will
      be no limitations anymore that would avoid keeping the most difficult
      Corals when it comes to the required chemistry of the water.
    </p>
    <p class="mat-body-1 text-light">
      Basically,all important Trace elements, major and minor are individually
      measured, adjusted and maintained above natural seawater levels. So,there
      will be no room for questioning if anything may be depleted or missing
      that may lead to poor coloration or insufficient growth.
    </p>
    <p class="mat-body-1 text-light">
      The adjustment and corrections on depleted elements are performed after an
      ICP test.
    </p>
    <p class="mat-body-1 text-light">
      Also a few Elements are supplemented daily, to take advantage of the daily
      need of certain elements that usually deplete within a day or two after
      dosing or water change.
    </p>
    <p class="mat-body-1 text-light">
      The beauty is that there will be no overdosing possible of any element,
      since each element is monitored and supplemented individually via a
      calculation tool that makes the determination how much solution and for
      how many days it will need to be dosedto achieve the desired level.
    </p>
    <p class="mat-body-1 text-light">
      As soon the monthly or bimonthly corrections are performed, there is no
      worry about the chemistry for quite a while, and there is no real need for
      struggle with Test kits that may or may not correctly indicate Iodine,
      Potassium, Strontium etc. besides the fact that many minor elements not
      very significantly change between testing, hence no need for struggle and
      reading coloring charts not to mention the cost to maintain and keep the
      test kits.
    </p>
    <p class="mat-body-1 text-light">
      No limitation on Livestock such as the most sensitive SPS species after
      the corrections, that require high level maintenance normally. This method
      brings the tank to highest level standards, without having a Masterâ€™s
      degree in Chemistry or Biology!
    </p>
    <p class="mat-body-1 text-light ">
      Results and improvements can take from a few days usually until full effect
      that normally is seen after the first few months. Also,there is potential
      to waive water changes, which many users do not perform anymore after
      applying this method.
